This folder contains source and compiled modules for a Gephi plugin. Note that
Gephi and its graph streaming plugin must be installed for this plugin to work.

To install, open Gephi, then the 'Tools' drop-down menu, 'Plugins', the
'Downloaded' tab, 'Add Plugins...', and browse to this folder to select the
'.nbm' file.

Then choose 'Install' and follow the instructions given.

To modify the source and recompile, you will need to download a development branch of Gephi (specifically, Andre' Panisson's Graph Streaming branch)
and open the project in NetBeans. Follow these directions to get started:

http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Plugins_portal

The branch you need will be 'lp:~panisson/gephi/graphstreaming' instead of
'lp:gephi'.
