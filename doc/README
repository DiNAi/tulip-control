TuLiP documentation
===================

Sphinx generated
----------------

Documentation is built using Sphinx, so the usual steps apply, i.e.

make html

Note that a Windows build file, make.bat, was auto-generated at the
time of first initialising the docs configuration files (ca. 2011 May 8)
but is not actively maintained.  It is included for convenience;
please consider Makefile to be the ground truth.


Format specifications
---------------------

The directory formats/ contains definitions and documentation about
data and file formats used in the project.  The goal is formalize
specifications expected in the code in a medium external to it.  Some
of this is done in docstrings, but formats/ should provide single and
normative points of reference.
