Documentation is built using Sphinx, so the usual steps apply, i.e.

make html

Note that a Windows build file, make.bat, was auto-generated at the
time of first initialising the docs configuration files but is not
actively maintained.  It is included for convenience; please consider
Makefile to be the ground truth.
