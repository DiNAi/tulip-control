Installation
============

TuLiP is known to work with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.  (This
comment matters given dependence on Python standard libraries.)  To
determine your default installed version of Python, open a new
terminal and type::

 $ python -V

Note that you may have more than one version installed.  On Unix
machines, these are typically named with the usual "python" followed
by a major and minor version number, e.g. "python2.6".  Try looking
for these with::

 $ ls /usr/bin/python*

The following packages are also *required*: `NumPy
<http://numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `CVXOPT
<http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/>`_, `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_, and `python-graph
<http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/>`_.  Except for python-graph,
these packages are quite standard in scientific computing environments
and may already be installed.  To check, open a new terminal and try::

 $ python -c 'import numpy'
 $ python -c 'import scipy'
 $ python -c 'import cvxopt'
 $ python -c 'import matplotlib'
 $ python -c 'import pygraph'

If an error message occurs, the package might not be visible on the
current path or may not be installed at all.  Try to install them
yourself, or see section "Troubleshooting" below for help.

The default (only) GR[1] synthesis tool used by TuLiP is implemented
in `JTLV <http://jtlv.ysaar.net/>`_. Thus you must have Java version
1.6 (or later) installed.  The Java runtime environment is standard on
most platforms. You can check whether it's on the path and, if so,
determine the version using::

 $ java -version

For receding horizon problems, you will need a tool for checking
satisfiability.  At present only `Yices <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>`_
is supported, so you must install it.  Once this is done, check that
it is on the shell path with::

 $ yices -V

which will return the installed version number.

For problems on continuous state spaces, you will need methods for
manipulating convex polytopes, computing partitions, etc.  In the
recent release this is by default achieved with `MPT
<http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~mpt/>`_ (the Multi-Parametric Toolbox), a
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ toolbox.  An
alternative implementation is under development; see
:ref:`no-mpt-sec-label`. If you are going to use MPT,
then its location must be added to the Matlab search path and it must
be initialized.  You can achieve both steps automatically each time
Matlab is opened by adding the following lines to your ``startup.m``
file::

 addpath(genpath('/path/to/mpt'));
 mpt_init;

where "/path/to/mpt" should be replaced with the location where you
placed MPT.  On Ubuntu GNU/Linux 11.04, running a default installation
of Matlab R2010a, ``startup.m`` is located under
``~/Documents/MATLAB/`` [#f1]_.  If there is no ``startup.m`` file
present, you can create one; try an empty file with the above lines
(and the mpt path suitably modified).

Once all of the above preparations are completed, you can install
TuLiP.  As with most `Distutils
<http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>`_-based packages,
installation proceeds with::

 $ python setup.py install

This script will also check for dependencies, i.e. look for NumPy,
CVXOPT, etc.


Other features (optional as of version 0.2a)
--------------------------------------------

Here are some optional advanced features that require installing additional dependencies. None of them is required to run the examples that come with the toolbox. Only in some examples you will be prompted to choose whether you would like to use Gephi visualization. You can simply say no if you don't have it installed.

Gephi visualization
```````````````````

If you would like to use the new visualization and simulation functions that are part of release 0.2a, you need to download and install `Gephi <http://gephi.org/>`_. After making sure gephi is on the path, you can install tulip-AutomatonSimulation plugin for Gephi. To install the plugin, open Gephi, then the 'Tools' drop-down menu, 'Plugins', the
'Downloaded' tab, 'Add Plugins...', and browse to this folder to select the 'org-tulip-automatonsimulation.nbm' file. Also select the 'org-gephi-layout-plugin.nbm' file. It contains an updated layout module that's necessary for the AutomatonSimulation plugin to work [#f2]_. Then choose 'Install' and follow the instructions given.

To check if Gephi is on your path, try::

$ which gephi

If this returns nothing, then you should add Gephi to your path. On Mac OS X, you can do this, for instance, by following the instructions from `this webpage <http://keito.me/tutorials/macosx_path>`_ where YOURPATHHERE should be set to the directory where Gephi is located on your machine. It is typically located under ``/Applications/gephi.app/Contents/MacOS/``.

.. _no-mpt-sec-label:

No MPT
``````

This version of TuLiP replicates all necessary polytope computations
from MPT (so there is no need for Matlab and MPT). However, if you
choose to use this functionality, it is highly recommended that you
install `GLPK <http://www.gnu.org/s/glpk/>`_ (a fast linear
programming solver). Note that you need to install GLPK **before**
installing CVXOPT and follow the instructions in CVXOPT installation
to ensure it recognizes GLPK as a solver. If you are a `MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>`_ user, please note that MacPorts does not
do this linking automatically.

To begin using this functionality, set the flag ``use_mpt`` to False
where appropriate. The most notable case is when calling
``discretize`` (defined in ``tulip.discretize`` module). In future
releases (after 0.2a) this flag will be set to False by default, thus
formally removing any dependency on MPT.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Regarding installation of numerical computing packages (NumPy, etc.),
for the love of all that is good, please run tests to verify proper
behavior!  ...unless you use a very well established install method.
Nonetheless, unit testing is always good practice.

If you think the necessary packages are installed, but are unsure how
to debug Python, then consider the following tips.  To see the python
path, execute::

 $ python -c 'import sys; print "\n".join(sys.path)'

Each path searched is listed on a new line. You can augment this list
by appending locations (separated by ":") to the environment variable
**PYTHONPATH**.  To see what it's currently set to, and add a new path
to "/home/frodo/work", use::

 $ echo $PYTHONPATH
 $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/frodo/work

You may need to tweak the export statement depending on your terminal
shell.  All of my examples are tested with zsh (the Z shell).


Ubuntu (or Debian) GNU/Linux
````````````````````````````

To install the python package dependencies, try::

 $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-cvxopt

Mac OS X
````````

For installing SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib, consider trying
`Scipy Superpack for Mac OSX
<http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/>`_ by Chris Fonnesbeck.

**If you are using MPT**, make sure you launch MATLAB from the command
line in the shell and set up MPT from there to avoid problems when
running examples with continuous dynamics.

If you launch MATLAB through a short-cut and setup MPT that way, even
if it looks as if it gets installed correctly, it won't work when you
launch MATLAB from the terminal later on (they just use different path
definitions in startup). Hence, when you call MPT within TuLiP, you
will get an error if you did not use terminal while setting up
MPT.

Installing other Python dependencies
````````````````````````````````````

The command ``pip install ...`` or ``easy_install ...`` will usually
suffice. To get `python-graph
<http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/>`_, try::

 $ easy_install python-graph-core

virtualenv and pydoc
````````````````````

If you have installed TuLiP into a `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_-built environment, then the
documentation may not be visible through `pydoc
<http://docs.python.org/library/pydoc.html>`_ .  There are more
sophisticated ways to fix this, but an easy solution is to augment the
path used by pydoc with an alias.  E.g., suppose your username is
"frodo", you are running Python v2.6, and your virtual environment is
called "PY_scratch" under your home directory.  Then the appropriate
alias is similar to::

 $ alias pydoc='PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/frodo/PY_scratch/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ pydoc'

To set this alias for every new terminal session, add the line to your
shell startup script; e.g., ``~/.bashrc`` for bash, or ``~/.zshrc``
for zsh.  To test it, try looking at the Automaton module by
entering::

 $ pydoc tulip.automaton


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] On Unix systems, in particular GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, the
         terminal shell treats ``~`` as a special symbol representing
         the home directory of the current user.

.. [#f2] The current Gephi build uses version 0.8.0.2 of the layout module;
         the version AutomatonSimulation plugin needs is 0.8.0.3. This extra
         step should become unnecessary once Gephi updates its release.
