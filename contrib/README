This ``contrib`` directory is a place for things that are not a part of TuLiP
per se but are still closely dependent and generally useful.  Their versions (if
given) are entirely independent of TuLiP.  Below is a summary of contents.

macports
  packaging via MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>

readdstar.py, spin2dstar.py
  interfacing with LTL2DSTAR <http://ltl2dstar.de/>.  These may later be
  incorporated into TuLiP, in particular the tulip.spec subpackage.
