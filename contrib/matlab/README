MATLAB Export
Stephanie Tsuei, 2014

This folder contains the files required to export controllers to Simulink
blocks and a couple examples for reference. Tulip, MATLAB, Simulink, and
Stateflow must all be installed. Provided files below:

	- stateflow_export.py - Converts Mealy Machines to Stateflow charts



USAGE

1) Run the converter after synthesis:

	from stateflow_export import to_stateflow
	...
	ctrl = synth.synthesize(...)               # returns a Mealy Machine
	to_stateflow(ctrl, 'machine.m')            # writes machine.m

2) In MATLAB, run machine.m. A new Simulink model containing the Mealy
   Machine should appear. Note that for the moment, exported Stateflow 
   charts are not very readable.



EXAMPLES

discrete.py is a modified version of /examples/robot_planning/discrete.py that
contains a line at the end for generating a Stateflow chart from the Mealy
Machine "ctrl".

discrete.slx is a Simulink Model (Probably requires MATLAB/Simulink R2012b or
higher) that shows the working Mealy Machine interacting with a randomly
generated park signal.



KNOWN ISSUES

1) Graphs are unreadable.

2) Doesn't support continuous controllers yet.
