MATLAB Export
Stephanie Tsuei, 2014

This folder contains the files required to export controllers to Simulink
blocks and a couple examples for reference. Tulip, MATLAB, Simulink, and
Stateflow must all be installed. Provided files below:

	- tomatlab.py
	- tostateflow.py



USAGE

1) Run the converter after synthesis:

	import tomatlab
	...
	ctrl = synth.synthesize(...)               # returns a Mealy Machine
	tomatlab.export('machine.m', ctrl)         # writes machine.m

2) In MATLAB, run machine.m. A new Simulink model containing the Mealy
   Machine should appear.


EXAMPLES

1) Discrete Example:

	discrete.py is a modified version of /examples/robot_planning/discrete.py
	that contains a line at the end for generating a Stateflow chart from the
	Mealy Machine "ctrl".

	discrete.slx is a Simulink Model (Probably requires MATLAB/Simulink R2012b
	or higher) that shows the working Mealy Machine interacting with a randomly
	generated park signal.



KNOWN ISSUES

1) Graphs are unreadable.

2) Support for continuous controllers is half-implemented.

3) Exported machine.m file only run when there is no instance of Simulink
   runnning.

4) machine.m file doesn't add timestep to Simulink Model
