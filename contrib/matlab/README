MATLAB Export
Stephanie Tsuei, January 2013

This folder contains the files required to export controllers to Simulink
blocks and a couple examples for reference. Tulip, MATLAB, Simulink, and
Stateflow must all be installed. Provided files below:

	-aut_to_stateflow.py - Converts Mealy Machines to Stateflow charts



USAGE

1) Run the converter after synthesis:

	import aut_to_stateflow
	...
	ctrl = synth.synthesize(...)                       # returns a Mealy Machine
	aut_to_stateflow.to_stateflow(ctrl, 'machine.m')   # writes machine.m

2) In MATLAB, run machine.m. A new Simulink model containing the Mealy
   Machine should appear. Note that for the moment, exported Stateflow 
   charts are not very readable.



EXAMPLES

discrete.py is a modified version of /examples/robot_planning/discrete.py that
contains a line at the end for generating a Stateflow chart from the Mealy
Machine "ctrl".

discrete.slx is a Simulink Model (Probably requires MATLAB/Simulink R2012b or
higher) that shows the working Mealy Machine interacting with a randomly
generated park signal.



KNOWN ISSUES

1) Graphs are unreadable. Once graphs are readable, then users should pick the
   initial state themselves through Stateflow. Currently, the script makes
   "Sinit" the initial state, which only works when the first environment input
   can pick the correct transition out of Sinit, which is the cases in the
   problem in discrete.py.

2) Doesn't support continuous controllers.
