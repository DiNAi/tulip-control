This directory contains instructions for installing Tulip in your home directory
on nessa.cds.caltech.edu. The instructions in Instructions.txt are also
applicable to other Linux servers on which one does not have sudo powers.

A couple notes:

1) You need to enable x-forwarding over ssh in order to use any modules that
   import matplotlib.

2) After following the directions in install.sh, your default Python
   installation will be the version of Python installed in your home directory,
   not the version installed on the machine for all users.
