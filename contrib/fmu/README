This directory contains the python and C files to export the TuLiP controller and a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation

Python Files:

ctrlexport.py : exporting the Mealy meachine
pppexport.py : exporting the proposition preserving partition
poly2str.py : miscellaneous functions for converting matrices and polytopes to C code
exportfmu.py : generating FMU

For compiling:

Makefile : The makefile for generating FMU

Example:

robotfmu.py : exporting the controller from robot_planning/continuous.py to FMU  
model.xml : the Ptolemy II file to run the simulation of robot_planning/continuous.py example
