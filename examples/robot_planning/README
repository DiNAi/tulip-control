This directory contains a simple robot planning planning example that
illustrates the usage of the TuLiP toolbox.

robot_discrete.py - discrete transition model
robot_continuous.py - continuous dynamics (with abstraction)
robot_disturbance.py - modification to include disturbance forces

In each of the examples, the task involves repeatedly visiting a cell,
responding to a parking signal, and avoiding an environmental
obstacle.
