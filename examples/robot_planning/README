This directory contains a simple robot planning example that illustrates the
usage of the TuLiP toolbox.

robot_discrete.py - discrete transition model
robot_gr1.py - alternative system description using GRSpec
robot_continuous.py - continuous dynamics (with abstraction)
robot_continuous_pwa.py - modification to include pwa dynamics

In each of the examples, the task involves repeatedly visiting a cell,
responding to a parking signal, and avoiding an environmental obstacle.
